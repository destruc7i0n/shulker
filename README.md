# shulker

> Connects [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) and [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) Servers by sending messages back and forth without any mods or plugins.

## Notice
This project has recently gone under a rewrite and the format for `config.json` is not directly backwards compatible with previous versions.
See [below](#upgrade-instructions) for details.

## In Action
![discord-mc](http://i.thedestruc7i0n.ca/I5anbg.gif)

## Features
- Sends message to and from Vanilla Minecraft servers
- Can send messages regarding advancements, when players join and leave, and player deaths
- Allows admins to send commands to Minecraft through Discord
 
## Installation and usage

Create a Discord bot here: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

Then, add the bot to your Discord server using the following link, replace the Client ID with that of your bot.
```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT ID>&scope=bot
```

In your Minecraft server.properties, make sure you have the following and restart the server:
```
enable-rcon=true
rcon.password=<your password>
rcon.port=<1-65535>
```

Clone repository onto a server, edit ```config.json``` (see below for more info) and change any options.
Then, in the repository folder:
```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn build && yarn start
```

If you are running this on the same server as the MC server, enable the `IS_LOCAL_FILE` flag and update related options below.
Otherwise, perform the following command on the server hosting (in a screen/tmux session or background process, make sure to replace your `YOUR_URL` with whatever URL you're using (`localhost:8000` if running on the same server and default config) and `PATH_TO_MINECRAFT_SERVER_INSTALL` with the path to the Minecraft server installation, such as `/usr/home/minecraft_server/`):

``` sh
tail -F /PATH_TO_MINECRAFT_SERVER_INSTALL/logs/latest.log | grep --line-buffered ": <" | while read x ; do echo -ne $x | curl -X POST -d @- http://YOUR_URL/minecraft/hook ; done
```
(The above command will also be given to you if you are not using a local file when you start up Shulker)

You can also easily Deploy to Heroku and the like, just be sure to edit `YOUR_URL` in the command to match accordingly.

```

## FAQ
* How do I make this work on a modded server?
  - Try replacing `REGEX_SERVER_PREFIX` with `"\\[Server thread/INFO\\] \\[.*\\]:"`
  
* Why can't I send commands even if I have the option enabled?
  - Make sure that you have a role on the server which is put in the array `SLASH_COMMAND_ROLES` case-sensitive.
    - e.g. `"SLASH_COMMAND_ROLES": ["Admin"]`

## Upgrade Instructions
From version 2 to version 3:
- The main change is that you need to split your `REGEX_MATCH_CHAT_MC` to both `REGEX_MATCH_CHAT_MC` and `REGEX_SERVER_PREFIX`.
  See the [configuration](#configuration) above for details.
